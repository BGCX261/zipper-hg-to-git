                  ZIPPER

ZIPPER finds a numerical approximation of the conformal map 
(and its inverse) of the unit disk onto any Jordan region  
(bounded or unbounded).  This version requires the X11 library on your
workstation and a fortran and C compiler.  It has been tested
on DEC, HP and SUN equipment.  

To run the demonstration programs:

read the file called README_f in the directory zipper and follow the
instructions for compiling the conformal mapping routines.
If you are having difficulties, it might help to look at logfile
and each command in demo.

read the file called README_C in the directory xcm and follow the 
instructions for compiling the graphics program xcm.

return to the parent directory (the current directory) and type

demo

After you are familiar with the use of demo, try

   demoresist (electric potential)

   demoflow   (fluid flow)

   demowhitney (whitney decomposition and geodesics)
