It looks like there is a point missing just before
the "other" stagnation point. But it is just
because of the square root at the tip of the slit
in the standard region. (Further tests to 
support this: try circular region also note
that as tip has smaller angle, pts move closer).

To change the size of the view window, so that
the flowlines extend farther away from the boundary,
change xsize and ysize in fluid.f to larger numbers.

./output/fluid.inp2 controls the number of points per line
and the number of flow lines.

Should really use image of unit circle, by applying forward, instead
of poly.dat in last plot, and ask the user if it is close enough
to the desired boundary.

add comment that first time thru just click on quit and you'll see
an example. or maybe invoke with xcm -e example.dat -o init.dat

Can use flow lines that tend to the boundary geometrically by changing
./output/fluid.inp2 (see fluid.f)
