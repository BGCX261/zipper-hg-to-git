xcm should compile and run on DECstations (Ultrix), DEC Alpha workstations
(OSF), and HP 700 series workstations that have the HP C compiler added (HPUX).
It has also been compiled on a SUN workstation. You may need to make changes 
in complex.c and xplane.c for SUN as described below.

   There is a freeware version of cc called gcc (gnu cc) that will 
   compile this code.

To create xcm, copy GCC_makefile or DEC_makefile, or HP_makefile, 
or SUN_makefile to makefile
then type 'make'. 


Compiling on SUN:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SUN's may have the system files float.h and limits.h and X11 libraries
   in directories not in the usual search path. The CFLAG -I adds the directory
   to the search path (the current version in SUN_makefile
   is the one that works at Hawaii).
   Also the C compile command is acc. If you can't find the files
   float.h and limits.h on your system, enclosed is a file called
   newfloat.h. To use it, change the line in complex.c
   #include <float.h>
   to
   #include "newfloat.h"
   
   Do the same in the file xplane.c
   and remove the line
   
   #include "limits.h"
   
   On some Sun's need to change all occurances of
   memmove to memcpy in textbox.c

Compiling on Dec 3000/400 with Dec OSF 1 v 3.0:
   Use ALPHA_makefile since the default optimization doesn't work correctly

*****************************************************************
You can alter the colors used in xcm. As an example, here are the
lines that I put in my .Xdefaults file:

Xcm*gridColor : orange
Xcm*subgridColor : yellow
Xcm*plane.foreground : blue
Xcm*plane.background : white
Xcm*background : white
Xcm*foreground : brown

Addendum 4-95: these are now the defaults. (see the file defaults.h)


As an alternative, you can use command line options (best done
via an alias):

xcm -gridcolor orange -subgridcolor yellow -planefg blue -planebg white -bg white -fg brown


You can edit the filenames in the text-boxes that appear when you select
'write' or 'print' by using the arrow keys and the delete key. 


BUGS:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not all command line options in options.h work at the moment.

Please send all bug reports to marshall@math.washington.edu. Thanks!
