To run this demonstration,
compile the fortran programs  by
copying DEC_makefile_f (or SUN_makefile_f or HP_makefile_f) 
  The only difference between these makefiles is the optimization
  option. In each case the optimizers have been disabled (see below)
to makefile then type: make

For example:

cp DEC_makefile_f makefile
make

(If none of the makefiles work on your system, look at the manual
page for f77 or whatever your fortran compiler is.
I'd appreciate a copy of the makefile you needed)

DO NOT USE ANY OPTIMIZER WITH YOUR FORTRAN COMPILE STATEMENTS. Essentially
every one I've ever used has some minor problem that becomes critical
with these routines.  

Don't use:  g77 - GNU project F77 Compiler (v0.5.5)
It has a lot of bugs.

The demo requires the program xcm, which 
is supplied in the directory xcm.
Compile the C program xcm by copying the appropriate Makefile to makefile 
then type: make
You can alter the colors used in xcm. As an example, here are the
lines that I put in my .Xdefaults file:

Xcm*gridColor : orange
Xcm*subgridColor : yellow
Xcm*plane.foreground : blue
Xcm*plane.background : white
Xcm*background : white
Xcm*foreground : brown


To run the demo type: demo 
and follow instructions.

To get rid of compiled programs and data files type: make clean
  (once for the fortran makefile and once for the C makefile)

Problems? Bugs? Drop me a note:  marshall@math.washington.edu
I'll do what I can.


I ask only one favor in return for these programs: Tell me what you
used them for.  

I will continue to make changes to the code, as suggestions are made.
Let me know if you want updates.
